Hi!

Welcome to Deadman, a simple Hangman console game.

# Features 
- Possible words list
- Available letters list
- Penalties
- Visual demonstration of word's current state
- and more

# Deficiencies
One known issue is that when players request a list of possible words, the game provides words based on guessed letters but does not consider available letters.

# If you would like to play

1. [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. [Download the game's source code](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/downloading-source-code-archives)
3. Create a word list file in the same folder as the game. Each word should be on a separate line.
4. Open your terminal or command prompt in the source file's directory.
5. Run the following command to start the game:
   - `py hangman.py`

Bye!
